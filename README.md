## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the [Airbnb Listings & Reviews](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=airbnb), which provides detailed information about Airbnb data for 250,000+ listings across 10 major cities, along with ~5 million guest reviews. The dataset can be downloaded and imported into Power BI to create visualizations and reports.
